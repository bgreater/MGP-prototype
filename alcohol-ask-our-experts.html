			<h2>Common Questions</h2>
			<h4>Are your wheat starch products gluten-free?</h4>
			<p>Most of our native and modified wheat starches have been tested for gluten content by the FARRP Laboratory (University of Nebraska, Lincoln) using an ELISA Method (R-Biopharm Ridascreen Gliadin). The results showed that the majority of these wheat starch products contain less than 20 ppm gluten, which complies with the gluten-free definition of Codex Alimentarius (CODEX STAN 118-1979, Revised 2008) and the proposed FDA regulations for gluten-free labeling issued in 2007 (Federal Register Proposed Rule – 72 FR 2795, January 23, 2007). While these are encouraging results, the level of residual gluten in wheat starch is oftentimes affected by process efficiency and other factors. For this reason, we need to work closely with our customers on their gluten-free projects so that we can define their needs, choose the right starch product, and develop the gluten-testing frequency and protocol.</p>

			<h4>Are your ingredients natural?</h4>
			<p>The USDA, but not FDA, has a regulatory definition for the word “natural”. The policy guide of the Food Standards and Labeling Division of the Food Safety and Inspection Service states that the term “natural” may be used on labeling for meat and poultry products provided the manufacturer of the products bearing the claim demonstrates that the product does not contain artificial flavor or flavoring, coloring ingredient or chemical preservative or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient, and the product and its ingredients are not more than minimally processed. Most FDA-regulated companies may be using the above definition or a modified version of it. Our specialty wheat starches and proteins are not considered natural based on the minimally processed requirement of the definition. However, we recommend our customers to contact our Customer Service Department to determine whether Arise® 8000 and native wheat starches and proteins would qualify for “natural” labeling.</p>

			<h4>What are the sulfite levels of your ingredients?</h4>
			<p>All of our native and specialty wheat starches are sulfite-free. Several of our specialty wheat protein ingredients (Arise® 5000, Arise® 6000, and FP™ 600) are treated with sodium metabisulfite as a processing aid. The average residual levels of sulfite (expressed as SO2) in the finished product are as follows: Arise® 5000: 36 ppm; Arise® 6000: 51 ppm; FP™ 600: 30 ppm</p>

			<hr>

			<h4>What are the protein levels of your ingredients?</h4>
			<p>Our wheat protein concentrates (vital wheat gluten, FP™ 300, and FP™ 600) and a partially hydrolyzed wheat gluten product, HWG 2009™, have a minimum protein content of 75% (N x 5.7, dry basis) as determined by Dumas method. The wheat protein isolates (Arise® 5000 and FPTM 1000 Isolate) possess a minimum of 90% protein while Arise® 8000 has a minimum of 94% protein and Arise® 6000 has a minimum of 85% protein (all expressed as N x 6.25, dry basis). The different TruTex® products vary in protein content and range from 50-75% (N x 6.25, dry basis). Majority of our native and specialty wheat starches are low in protein (no more than 0.5%) when determined by Dumas Method and contain < 20 ppm residual gluten when analyzed by ELISA Method (R-Biopharm Ridascreen Gliadin).</p>

			<hr>

			<h4>What are the usage levels of your ingredients?</h4>
			<p>The usage level depends on the ingredient and the finished product formulation. For example, the usage level for our resistant wheat starch, Fibersym®RW, depends on the particular recipe and the fiber claim desired by the customer. In cases like these, we work closely with our customer to input the recipe in Genesis software for nutritional calculation. Then, the desired additional fiber (contributed by Fibersym®RW taking into account its 85% minimum fiber content) is calculated per defined serving size depending on whether it is for “good source” or “excellent source” of fiber claim.</p>

			<p>In bakery products, wheat protein isolates (Arise® 5000 and Arise® 6000) are used at low levels ranging from 0.5-1.5% based on wheat flour. For all of our native and specialty starch and protein ingredients, we recommend that customers contact our Applications Technology Department to assist them with their formulation needs.</p>
