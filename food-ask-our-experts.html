			<h2>Common Questions</h2>
			<h4>What does the term “resistant starch” mean?</h4>
			<p>The term “resistant starch” was coined in 1982 when British research scientists discovered the existence of enzyme-resistant starch in bread and cooked and cooled potatoes. The official definition for resistant starch was developed in 1992, which states that it is “the sum of starch and products of starch degradation not absorbed in the small intestines of healthy individuals”.</p>

			<hr>

			<h4>How is resistant starch different from sources of conventional fibers?</h4>
			<p>It has been long recognized that there are two kinds of conventional fiber --- insoluble fiber and soluble fiber. Insoluble fiber is represented by cellulose, lignin and some insoluble hemicelluloses. Soluble fiber is represented by pectins, gums, mucilages, inulin, fructooligosaccharides and some soluble hemicelluloses.</p>

			<p>Resistant starch originates from starch in foods that escapes digestion in the small intestine. It differs compositionally from the conventional fibers by being from a starch source.</p>

			<h4>Do you have formulations for finished foods?</h4>
			<p>Our Applications Technology group is actively involved in formulating our native and specialty wheat starches and proteins in various food products. For specific ingredient and food product applications, we recommend that our customers contact the Applications Technology group so that their needs can be satisfied.</p>

			<hr>

			<h4>What do you mean by ambient temperatures for storage?</h4>
			<p>Ambient storage signifies that our products do not require controlled storage temperature or controlled humidity. Our products do not have to be refrigerated or kept warm.  An ideal storage condition is low relative humidity and around 22ºC(72ºF). It is important that storage areas are kept dry and sanitary. </p>

			<hr>

			<h4>What is the shelf life of your ingredients?</h4>
			<p>Our Fibersym®RW and FiberRite®RW resistant wheat starch products and the TruTex® line of textured protein products have a two-year shelf life. All other products have a one-year shelf life.</p>

			<hr>

			<h4>Are you ISO certified?</h4>
			<p>Yes. MGP is certified to ISO 14001 (Certified Environmental Management System) and OHSAS 18001 (Certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System).</p>
