  	<p>During the years from 1946 to the present, MGP Ingredients has built a solid reputation in the beverage alcohol industry based on four assumptions. Customers want quality product. They need a consistent and adequate supply of these products. Fast delivery is important, and customers expect reliable service.</p>

	<p>By adhering to strict quality control standards, MGP consistently supplies premium distilled gins, grain neutral spirits, bourbon and corn and rye whiskeys. Because of constant upgrades, coinciding with evolving customer needs, we are able to meet demand for world class beverage products. Every facet of our alcohol department is conducted with service in mindâ€”service on which our customers can rely.</p>

	<p>While MGP has expanded its business over the years, our basic goals remain unchanged. We continue to make every effort to maintain high standards of excellence achieved in product quality and service. In the areas of supply and product delivery, MGP has consistently met challenges to effectively serve the changing needs of our customers.</p>

	<p>The central location of our facilities enables us to deliver products quickly and cost effectively. Because we are located in the heart of the grain belt, grain raw materials are readily available. Additionally, our facilities are ideally located for truck, rail and barge traffic.</p>

	<p>The Beverage Alcohol Department at MGP continues to honor its tradition of quality products, delivered in quantity. Customer formulas for gin continue to be welcomed and produced to precise specifications. Nearly seven decades of experience backed by personalized service and attention are distinct qualities we offer in creating greater value for our customers.</p>
